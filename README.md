# 2D-sandbox-game
A small fun to play around project containing various things to do.

I have included a test map containing a 4 bit in-game calculator named 0.txt You can open it by having selected the Air block and clicking the Load button.(The Save button  saves different maps on specific blocks which you are holding).
